/**
 * Silent debounced autosave of the per-stage draft. Timers live in a ref keyed
 * by stage, so an armed payload always reaches the server: effect re-runs and
 * stage switches never cancel a pending timer — only a newer arm for the same
 * stage (debounce) or unmount does.
 *
 * Draft writes are optimistic concurrency on a server-assigned revision:
 * every PUT carries `expectedRevision` — the revision the client last saw
 * applied for that stage (0 when none). The server applies the write only
 * while that still equals its stored revision and answers with the assigned
 * (`applied: true`) or current stored (`applied: false`) revision, so a stale
 * write can never resurrect an older draft and client clocks play no role.
 * The draft snapshot is taken when the timer arms — the dirty flag marks
 * THAT draft — while `expectedRevision` is computed when a request sends, so
 * a save that applied between arm and send still raises it. Four guards make
 * that safe in a live editor:
 *
 * - One request per stage at a time: a timer that fires while its stage's
 *   earlier save is still in flight queues instead of sending; when the
 *   response lands, the newest queued arm sends with a freshly computed
 *   expectedRevision. Without it two of our own writes would race each other
 *   into a false conflict and clobber newer local edits.
 * - The draft snapshot is per arm, not read at send time: `draftOf` in the
 *   committed options returns the stage the page is showing NOW, which would
 *   send the wrong stage's draft once the learner has switched away.
 * - A resolving request reports its completion only while it is still the
 *   stage's latest arm, so an older in-flight save can never overwrite a
 *   newer dirty state — and a response from an earlier context (unmount or
 *   class switch, including A→B→A) is generation-checked and dropped before
 *   it can cancel the new context's timers or fire conflict handling.
 * - A rejected write (`applied: false`) means the server holds a newer
 *   write from elsewhere. The stage is then fenced: its queued arm and any
 *   still-debouncing timer die with it — letting one send would carry the
 *   reconciled revision on content that predates it and silently overwrite
 *   the winning write — `onConflict` fires so the caller can refetch and
 *   reconcile, and no new arm for that stage may leave until the lesson
 *   state has caught up to the revision the rejection reported (the re-arm
 *   gate below). A failed refetch leaves the fence up: the caller flags the
 *   stage as sync-error instead of resolved and only an explicit retry may
 *   lift it. Only then does a dirty flag schedule a write that legitimately
 *   supersedes the server draft.
 * - The component library is one project-wide resource, so its concurrency
 *   rules are project-wide too: only one component-carrying request may be
 *   in flight at a time (a second same-client send would race the first's
 *   revision into a false conflict), and a REFUSED component write fences
 *   every later component-carrying send — not only the refusing stage's —
 *   until the lesson state resyncs BOTH the library snapshot and its
 *   revision. A fenced send is PARKED, never dropped: its stage keeps a
 *   pending save task that re-sends once the resync lifts the fence, so a
 *   fenced stage can never end up with neither a save task nor a recovery
 *   path. The revision a refusal reports is a resync target, never an
 *   adopted counter: the client may only claim a new library revision
 *   after its own write applied or a full snapshot landed (the reconcile
 *   path delivers them together).
 *
 * The lifecycle callbacks all receive the stage they fired for; the lesson
 * reducer keeps flags per stage so one stage's late completion cannot
 * clobber the flag of the stage now on screen.
